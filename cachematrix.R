## These two functions create a matrix and cache its inverse

## This function creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing
## a function to get and set both the value of the matrix and its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with 
## the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
## already been calculated and uses the value from the cache accordingly.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached inverse matrix")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
